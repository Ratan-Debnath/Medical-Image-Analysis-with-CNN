# Medical-Image-Analysis-with-CNN
Built a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python using TensorFlow/Keras to classify chest X-ray images as NORMAL or PNEUMONIA. Trained and evaluated the model on Kaggleâ€™s chest X-ray dataset, achieving ~91% accuracy. Implemented data augmentation and visualized results. Deployed predictions on new images with interpretation.
